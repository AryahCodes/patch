**RE: Formal Complaint Regarding Pest Infestation at [Your Apartment Address] and Demand for Remediation**

Dear [Landlord's Name],

This letter constitutes a formal complaint regarding a persistent and unacceptable pest infestation at my residence, located at [Your Apartment Address]. The presence of these pests, specifically [Be specific about the type of pests, e.g., rodents, cockroaches, bedbugs. The more detail the better], constitutes a breach of my lease agreement and renders my apartment uninhabitable.

As I am residing in the state of 'None', I am unable to provide the exact state and local laws. As a tenant, I am entitled to a safe and habitable living environment, free from conditions that pose a threat to my health and well-being. Generally, a landlord has the responsibility to maintain a clean and safe property.

The pest infestation is causing me significant distress and poses a potential health risk. I have taken [Explain any steps you have taken to mitigate the problem, e.g., cleaned, reported the issue verbally, etc.]. However, the problem persists and requires professional intervention.

Therefore, I formally demand that you take immediate and decisive action to eradicate this pest infestation. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Engaging a qualified and licensed pest control professional to inspect the premises and implement a comprehensive treatment plan.
*   Taking all necessary steps to seal entry points and prevent future infestations.

I expect the above measures to be implemented within **seven (7) days** of the date of this letter. Please provide me with a written confirmation of the steps you will take to address this issue within **three (3) days**.

Please be advised that if you fail to take the necessary steps to remedy this pest infestation within the specified timeframe, I will be forced to pursue all available legal remedies. These remedies may include, but are not limited to:

*   **Withholding rent**: [If you choose this route, you absolutely MUST consult with a lawyer first. Rent withholding has very specific legal requirements, and doing it incorrectly can lead to eviction].  In some jurisdictions, tenants are permitted to withhold rent and/or use the rent money to hire a qualified professional.
*   **Filing a complaint with the local health department**: This is generally done to ensure the living conditions are safe.
*   **Pursuing legal action in small claims court**: To recover damages for any losses incurred as a result of the pest infestation, including but not limited to, property damage, medical expenses, and emotional distress.
*   **Terminating my lease agreement**: I may seek to break the lease without penalty due to the breach of the implied warranty of habitability.

I am hopeful that we can resolve this matter amicably and promptly. I look forward to your immediate attention to this serious issue.

Sincerely,

[Your Signature]

**Important Considerations and Disclaimers:**

*   **State and Local Laws:** This letter is a template and MUST be revised to comply with the specific laws of your state (and municipality, if applicable). Research your state's landlord-tenant laws thoroughly, focusing on the "warranty of habitability," landlord's duty to repair, and tenant remedies for landlord's failure to repair.
*   **Consult with a Lawyer:** Before sending this letter, it is highly recommended to consult with a landlord-tenant lawyer in your area. They can provide legal advice specific to your situation and help you understand your rights and options.
*   **Documentation:** Keep copies of all correspondence, photos, videos, and any other evidence related to the pest infestation. This documentation will be crucial if you need to pursue legal action.
*   **Delivery Method:** Send the letter via certified mail with return receipt requested so you have proof that the landlord received it.
*   **Withholding Rent:** **Do not withhold rent without first consulting with an attorney.** Rent withholding is a complex legal issue with specific requirements that must be followed carefully. Failure to do so could result in eviction.
*   **Landlord-Tenant Relationship:** Remember that you have an ongoing relationship with your landlord. While you need to be firm in demanding your rights, try to maintain a respectful tone in your communications to the extent possible.

Good luck! Remember to seek professional legal advice before taking any action.
